## 🔍 Purpose & Problem Solved

Traditional car resale often relies on subjective pricing and negotiation, leading to market discrepancies and customer distrust.  
**VroomValue** leverages predictive modeling to offer fair, accurate, and real-time selling price estimates, helping:

- **Sellers** get realistic pricing to avoid undervaluation.  
- **Buyers** make better offers based on predicted value.  
- **Resellers** reduce price conflicts and speed up transactions.

## 🚀 Innovation & Impact

- 🚀 **Deployed XGBoost Regression**, outperforming Linear and Random Forest models in accuracy and robustness.  
- 💡 Integrated a clean, interactive web UI for non-technical users to access predictive analytics effortlessly.  
- 🔁 Achieved automated end-to-end prediction pipeline, eliminating the need for manual calculations or domain expertise.  
- ✅ Boosted user trust by introducing a transparent, explainable model output.

## 📊 Features Used in Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- `Car_Name`
- `Year`
- `Selling_Price`
- `Present_Price`
- `Kms_Driven`
- `Fuel_Type`
- `Seller_Type`
- `Transmission`
- `Owner`

## 🧠 ML Models Applied

We applied and compared three different regression algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **XGBoost Regression** ✅ *(Best Performing Model)*

After testing and comparing the models, **XGBoost Regressor** showed the highest accuracy and was selected as the final model for deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 📌 Machine Learning & Data Analysis
- `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data handling & wrangling
- `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib` – Data visualization
- `Scikit-learn` – ML models and preprocessing
- `XGBoost` – Final ML model

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection and scaling
- Train-test split

### 🌐 Frontend
- Developed a **user-friendly web interface** where users can input values and instantly get predictions.
- No need to run code locally – just input and predict!

## 📈 Data Visualization

We used `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to explore the dataset and understand relationships between features. Key insights were gathered to improve model accuracy and guide feature engineering.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User inputs car details through the frontend.
2. Data is passed to the backend ML model.
3. The trained **XGBoost Regressor** predicts the estimated selling price.
4. Output is displayed in real-time.
